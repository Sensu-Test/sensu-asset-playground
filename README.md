# sensu-asset-playground
My personal attempt to create a reusable sensu asset.

## Workflow as it exists in my head:
1) archive non-binary artifacts in this repository
2) build binaries as local only artifacts
3) build platform asset tarballs as build host artifact
4) update repo docs with correct hash for tarball
5) generate github release and include platform asset tarballs
